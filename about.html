<h1>about</h1>
<p>i am a 25 year old human with a passion for philosophy, thought, understanding of the world, psychonautics and other things</p>
<h1>philosophy</h1>
<p>to throw in couple labels of stuff i am into:</p>
<ul>
<li>postmodernity (although sometimes as a criticism of postmodern thought but then is commentary part of the tradition that is a good question to write an essay about)</li>
<li>buddhism, especially zen and shingon</li>
<li>ancient chinese philosophy, legalism and taoism mainly</li>
<li>ancient greek, although focusing mostly on pre- and post-socratics, plato is there of importance, but much more focus goes to heraclitus and epicurus i would say as of strawberry moon 2023</li>
<li>individualist anarchism, mostly stirner and other stuff that bookchin would get angry about</li>
<li>would probably enjoy american transcendentalism if it were not for their style</li>
<li>we are all kantians</li>
<li>ecology, sometimes deep, sometimes leftist, sometimes all other styles, ecology but like skating (or  derive)</li>
<li>situationists</li>
<li>quakerism especially whetever john woolman said</li>
</ul>
<h1>tech</h1>
<ul>
<li>plan 9 (although not using it right now as much as i want to)</li>
<li>forth (ditto)</li>
<li>linux? (it puts food on the table although to say it has issues, its issues are the issues of our society)</li>
<li>openbsd (mostly cause they are just cool B))</li>
</ul>
<h1>music</h1>
<ul>
<li>just anything atmospheric</li>
<li>just anything noisy</li>
<li>i will write articles if there is something i enjoy in particular</li>
<li>i have no idea what do we consider good taste</li>
</ul>
<h1>other stuff</h1>
<ul>
<li>psychadelics (occasional, using it more as an experience than escapism although what is escapism) [bill clinton voice: i have never had any experience of using psychadelics outside of Kingdom of the Netherlands)</li>
<li>cycling</li>
<li>piracy culture (both)</li>
<li>psychonautics, although with sober meditations i constantly question myself as the internet discourse harmed me to the level that i cannot have pure experience</li>
</ul>
