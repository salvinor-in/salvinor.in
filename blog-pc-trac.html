<h1>Quick guide to CST/Xkeys PC-trac/O-trac/Kidtrac</h1>
<p>O-trac and PC-trac seem to be the same trackball model made by different
companies due to buyout. It is a classic trackball model without a
scrolling functionality.</p>
<p>There are a couple varieties of this trackball, described in detail
<a href="https://www.ergocanada.com/detailed_specification_pages/clearly_superior_technologies_pc_trac.html#models">here</a>. I have CST1150 model, I would be thankful for inputs from people
with Pro models to make this guide more comprehensive.</p>
<p>One can find <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120710080618/http://clearlysuperiortech.com/files/file____Y__CST_cd1_index.pdf">manuals here</a>, although they do not provide too much
useful data.</p>
<p>This is a short guide to using and setting up this trackball.</p>
<h2>Middle click</h2>
<p>By default, the middle click is terrible. If you click it once, it goes
into drag-hold mode which is useless, and when you hold it for 2.5s it
will <s>explode</s> go into scroll mode. To leave the scroll mode,
press any other key. I bet there are people who prefer this scheme.</p>
<p>To fix this, you need to solder to bridge two pins on the board. Then,
you will have normal middle click and you can start using the trackball
properly.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the two pins in questions. They are on the right
side of the reset square in the bottom corner of said square.</p>

<h2>Scrolling</h2>
<p>After you have resolved this, now you need scrolling. To get this
functionality, you can go two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>enable auto-scrolling in applications that provide it (i.e. Firefox)</li>
<li>enable it system-wide</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable it system-wide, follow <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/624655/how-to-configure-the-elecom-huge-trackball-to-scroll-with-the-ball">this guide</a>, just remember to change
the scroll button to 2 (middle) or 3 (right). I have tested this and
found it not useful for me, prefer per-application as this blocks moving
the mouse while having the middle or right button pressed.</p>
<h2>Accelaration</h2>
<p>By default, acceleration is pretty low. For linux, install <code>xinput</code>, and then run following commands</p>
<pre><code>xinput # to get the list of devices
xinput set-prop 'CST CST USB UNITRAC' 'libinput Accel Speed' 1.0 # to set the accel speed, adjust the device name if it is different
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this only sets it for current session <strong>and</strong> currently
plugged in devices, unplugging the device and plugging it back in will
disable the setting. To have this set permanently either set it up in
xorg.conf or use a script which checks if device is plugged in and then
sets the accelaration speed to the correct one.</p>
<p>An example of a working script (using <a href="http://eradman.com/entrproject/">entr</a>):</p>
<pre><code>cd /dev/input/; while sleep 0.1; do echo by-id | entr -d xinput set-prop 'CST CST USB UNITRAC' 'libinput Accel Speed' 1.0 ; done
</code></pre>
<p>Put this one in auto-run, so it will work fine.</p>
